# House-Price-Prediction
Training Machine Learning Model to predict house prices based on various features. 

The dataset used have been imorted from Kaggle. 

There are 21 columns in the dataset. The dataset does not require cleaning as of now. just feature selection and model training. 

I used Decision Tree Regression Model as I need more than 1 feature to trian my model ( House prices vary based on various factors/features). 

Later on in this project I will be adding or addressing topics including - "Overfitting & Underfitting", "Accuracy of Model", "Future Scope".
